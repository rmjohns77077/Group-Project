//Point of Sale TERMINAL
//Write a cash register or self-service terminal for some kind of retail location.  Obvious choices include a small store, a coffee shop, or a fast food restaurant.
//Your solution must include some kind of a product class with a name, category, description, and price for each item. 
//12 items minimum; stored in a list.
//Present a menu to the user and let them choose an item (by number or letter).
//Allow the user to choose a quantity for the item ordered.
//Give the user a line total (item price * quantity).
//Either through the menu or a separate question, allow them to re-display the menu and to complete the purchase.
//Give the subtotal, sales tax, and grand total.  (Remember rounding issues the Math library will be handy!)
//Ask for payment type—cash, credit, or check
//For cash, ask for amount tendered and provide change.
//For check, get the check number.
//For credit, get the credit card number, expiration, and CVV.
//At the end, display a receipt with all items ordered, subtotal, grand total, and appropriate payment info.
//Return to the original menu for a new order.  (Hint: you’ll want an array or List to keep track of what’s been ordered!)
//Optional enhancements:
//(Moderate)Store your list of products in a text file and then include an option to add to the product list, which then outputs to the product file.
//(Buff) Do a push up every time you get an exception or error while running your code
